# Music-Genre-Classification

This project implements the various basic machine learning algorithms to classify music into different genres. The dataset used for this is the famous GTZAN database. http://marsyas.info/index.html
The patterns from the music are extracted using Mel-frequency cepstrum(MFCC). Models Used:
- Support Vector Machines(SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN) 
- Convolutional neural network(CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN).
